- place the test ts files in tests/scripts
- it's safe to leave tests there for future reference
- each test has to have an expectation comment, one of:
- // expect: ... - the value is going to be compared with the value of the last statement in the file
- // expects_runtime_error: ... - runtime error must contain string
- // expect_compile_error: ... - compile (or type) error must contain string
